# Late Nites - A Stardew Valley mod

![Late Nites](/latenites.png)

Do you often find yourself short on time? Taking dirt naps at 2:00 AM every night in the mines? 
Ever wish there was a self-checkout at Pierre's avaliable after dark or at the crack of dawn? Well then this
is the Stardew mod for you!
Now you can buy stuff without someone at the counter and extend store hours to 6:00 AM to 2:00 AM!

    Blacksmith Clint's shop
    Carpenter Robin's shop
    Marnie's animal shop
    Gunther's Museum
    Pierre's shop
    Willy's fish shop

## Installation

These mods require SMAPI and Content Patcher to work properly.

Here's more infomation on how to install [SMAPI](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Getting_Started) and [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915).

Download the latest release of this mod [here](https://github.com/montgomerysamantha/LateNites/releases/).

Unpack the zip file, move the "[CP] Late Nites" and "Late Nites" folders into the Mods section of the game directory (or use any Stardew Valley mod manager).

Launch the game with SMAPI as usual. 

## Background and Information

Avaliable in English, French, and Korean currently (please contact me if you want to add more translations!).

I created this mod as a tool for myself since I often was frustrated by stores closing early and Marnie always seems to be gone from her shop. :(
With this, she can go hang out with Mayor Lewis all the time lol.

Now all of the shops are essentially like your local 7/11 and open all the time, or as close as I could make it.
I extended the hours from 6:00 AM to 2:00 AM, and I hope to add more late-game locations soon.
The game handles time using an extended 24 hour clock (ex: 6:00AM is 600, midnight is 2400, 2:00AM is 2600 for those that need it :D)

In the future, I would like to add support for Stardew Valley Expanded shops and potentially create a seperate "Unlock Everything" mod as well, since it's
hard to chat with the townsfolk after 8:00 PM. 

## Potential Future Features:
- Add an "away" message for Clint
- Joja Mart support
- Stardew Valley Expanded Edition support
- Config file for buildings to be locked/unlocked
- Unlock ALL doors, regardless of heart levels
- Keep doors unlocked on special event days (Flower dance, Halloween, Winter Festival, and others)

## Recent Updates
- Museum now unlocks at 6:00AM, can donate artifacts and collect rewards as needed
- Willy's shop now opens at 6:00AM
- Blacksmith support added
- Right clicking on door now works to open it

## Known Issues
- Gunther does not move, ever, from what I can tell. So it's hard to test if the self-serve is working. I might have to download a Gunther mod to get this 
fully working and tested.
- I need a few more French and Korean translations for the Museum and Blacksmith.
- Clint's trash can upgrades are buggy, see issues for more info

## Credits

The self-service portions of this mod are forks of the original repos from [Jarvie8176](https://github.com/Jarvie8176) and [AleronWen](https://github.com/AleronWen/StardewMods).
All credit goes to them on that, I have overhaulled and resdesigned the project to suit my needs.
Extended hours Content Pack portions were created by me.

## Bugs
Feel free to report bugs, feature requests, in the issues category on GitHub. I will try to keep this mod maintained with later versions of SMAPI but can't make any promises. :)
